00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Hey, thanks for meeting me here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Yeah, no problem. What's going on?

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,500
I don't really know how to say this, so I'm just going to say it.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,200
You're starting to scare me. What happened?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,800
I found the letters, David. The ones you hid in your desk.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,000
What? What letters? I don't know what you're talking about.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,400
Don't lie to me! I read every single one of them!

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,500
You've been writing to her for months behind my back!

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,200
Okay, okay, just calm down. Let me explain.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,000
Explain what? That our entire relationship has been a joke to you?

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,500
No! That's not what happened. Just listen to me, please.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,200
Those letters were for my sister. She's been sick, really sick.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,500
Wait... what? Your sister? You told me she moved abroad.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,800
She did. She's in a hospital in London. Stage three. I didn't know how to tell you.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh my God. David, I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,200
I've been pretending everything is fine but it's not. Nothing is fine.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,500
I feel like the worst person alive. I accused you of something horrible.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's okay. I should have told you from the beginning.

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
No, it's not okay. I went through your things like some kind of psycho.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,800
Hey, stop. You're not a psycho. You were scared. I get it.

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,000
The doctors said if the treatment works, she could be home by summer.

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,000
Really? Oh that's wonderful! She's going to make it!

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,500
I really hope so. She's the strongest person I know.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We should go visit her. Together. I want to be there for you.

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,500
You would do that? After everything that just happened?

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Of course I would. That's what love is, you idiot.

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Come here. I love you so much.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I love you too. Now let's go book those plane tickets.
